# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project comes from the [Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset/data).

This data set describes a variety of demographic and logistic information related to consumer purchases throughout the United States. One instance of data includes information regarding who the consumer is, what they purchased, when they purchased it, where they purchased it, and how they purchased it. An example row of data can be seen below:

## Questions & Tasks

The purpose of this project is to provide visualizations that would assist in driving data-based decision-making for the company. The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which states / regions have the best ratings and get the most purchases?
 * Which products are most popular by gender, season, and region?
 * Are different demographics more likely to be regular customers?
 * Which demographics and products provide the most sales in different states and overall?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
